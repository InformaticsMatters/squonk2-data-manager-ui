## Logging in - a How To guide

To do anything useful in the Squonk Data Manager you must be authenticated. Squonk uses
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution. To be able to use Squonk you must first
have an account in the appropriate Keycloak instance and then log in using your username and password (or whatever other
mechanisms that Keycloak instance might offer such as "log in with Google").

The Keycloak instance might allow you to register yourself with an account or might require you to contact an
administrator to set up the account for your before you can use it.

Once you have an account you can log in to the Squonk Data Manager using the **Account** drop down in the top right
corner and choosing the **Login** option.

<Image src={login} alt="User menu" />

That will take you to Keycloak where you can authenticate (the exact details of the authentication options may differ
from this example):

<Image src={keycloak} alt="Keycloak login" />

To log out use the same **Account** drop down in the top right corner and choosing the **Logout** option.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Container>{children}</Container>
  </Layout>
);

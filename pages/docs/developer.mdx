## A Squonk2 Deployment

What you see as the **Squonk Data Manager** when you use it from the web interface is actually a number of components that
have been deployed to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.
We already have multiple deployments, but examples here refer to our
[reference site](https://squonk.it/data-manager-ui) that is running on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Other deployments would have basically the same components but at different URLs.

## Systems Overview

### Keycloak Single Sign On (SSO)

Authentication for all the Squonk products is handled through a [Keycloak server](https://www.keycloak.org/) which
provides SSO capabilities using the OpenID Connect Identity provider. To do almost anything you must first be authenticated.
Once you have signed in you get access to all the systems in that deployment that you are allowed access to without
needing to log in again.

### Data Manager API

This is an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) compliant REST API implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/),
and available also through a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). It provides the majority of the functions
that you see in the UI such as managing datasets and the contents of a project, executing jobs and applications and
viewing the results of those executions.

The Swagger UI for the reference site can be found [here](https://squonk.it/data-manager-api/api/).

### Account Server API

This is a separate service that handles the concepts of users, organisations, units, accounting and billing.
The idea is that multiple applications (e.g Data Manager API) would use the same Account Server to that the usage of
a user, organisation and unit is consolidated in one place. A single subscription gets you access to multiple services.

Typically you don't notice the Account Server as a separate application as it would be seemlessly integrated into the
client application, which is exactly how it works in the Data Manager web interface - you work with organisations and
units but don't notice that this is actually being done through interactions with a separate service.

Account Server is also an OpenAPI compliant REST API implemented in Python, available through a Swagger UI.

The Swagger UI for the reference site can be found [here](https://squonk.it/account-server-api/api/).


### Data Manager Web interface

If you are reading this document you are probably already using the web interface. This is a web application implemented
using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) that uses the Data Manager and Account Server APIs.
It too is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. If you're not already there here is the location of the
[reference site](https://squonk.it/data-manager-ui).

### Clients for programatic access
  
#### Python

We have created a Python client for working with the Data Manager API. If you are wanting to work with the API programmatically
using this might be much easier than using the API directly, but not all functions of the API are available through the client.

Documentation for the client can be found [here](https://squonk2-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable).


#### JavaScript / Node
  
We have also created a client for accessing the DM. This is used to create the UI. It provides `async` functions to make request along with `react-query` hooks to handle query caching, refetching and so on. This package is generated automatically from the OpenAPI schema and is fully typed with `typescript`. Requests are made with Axios which is compatible in NodeJS and not just in the browser. 
  
* The docs are available [here](https://informaticsmatters.github.io/data-manager-npm-client/)
* The package is published on NPM as [@squonk/data-manager-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@squonk/data-manager-client)

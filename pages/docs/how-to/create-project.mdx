## Creating projects - a How To guide

You can create a new project in the **Settings tab**. See the
[Setting your work context How To guide](context) for general info about your project context.
This guide deals with the specifics of creating a **new project**.

A **project** is created within your currently selected **unit**. You can only do this in your own **personal** **unit**
within the **Default** **organisation** or within a **unit** of another **organisation** if you are an owner of that
**unit**. The **organisation** owner needs to make you a member of the **unit**. You *do not* need to be a member of
a **unit** in order to use a **project** in that **unit**. The owner of the **project** can add you as an **editor**
or the project to give you write access to the **project** and you will have read access to any public projects in the
unit.

The *Create Project* button will be present in the *Context* section of the *Settings panel* if you are able to create a
project in the current **context**. If you click on this you get a dialog that lets you specify the project details.

You need to give your new project a sensible name, choose which tier of project you want and whether you want the project
to be public or private (Evaluation tier projects cannot be private).

The different tiers are described in the [Concepts guide](../concepts).

Once you have made your choices click on the CREATE button to create your project.
Remember that the owner of the **unit** is responsible for the costs of your project. In the case of a **personal unit**
in the **Default organisation** that means you!

You can add additional users to your project. These can either be as *editor* or *observers*. *Editors* have full access
to the project, effectively the same rights as you, the *owner*. *Observers* can see the content, but cannot change
anything and cannot execute jobs. To add users to your project click the edit button in the action to the right of your
project listing and add the users you want to the *Editors* and *Observers* sections.

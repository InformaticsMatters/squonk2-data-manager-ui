Welcome to the **Squonk Data Manager**, a tool designed for running **scientific workflows**.

The **Squonk Data Manager** is at the core of the Squonk 2.0 suite of applications.
It provides a managed environment for your datasets and allows execution of applications and jobs that use that data to derive new data.
Currently it is focussed around **virtual screening** workflows, but the scope will expand over time.

Data is at the heart of the Squonk Data Manager. Your datasets stay in the same place, and applications fire up around the data. This is the *"bring the compute to the data"* paradigm.

This managed data environment is highly collaborative in nature, allowing sharing of data and skills across a workgroup, but in a secure manner.
In this public demo site all data is public and computational resources are limited.

All of this takes place in a Kubernetes cluster, providing high resilience and scalability.

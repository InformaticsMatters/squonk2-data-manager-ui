## Setting your work context - a How To guide

Most activity in Squonk Data Manager requires you to have selected a **project** you want to work in.
We refer to this as the **Project context**, or just **context**.
The best way to do this is to use the **Settings** option in the **Account** menu in the top right corner.
The settings panel opens full screen (close it when finished).

You can select a **context** which includes the **organisation** and **unit** within that **organisation** that you want to
work in. The administrators of that **organisation** and **unit** will need to have added you as member, or given you access to a
**project** in the unit. See the [concepts document](/docs/concepts) for a description of
these concepts.

If you not a member of a **unit** or **project** in a named **organisation** you can still create a **project** in the **Default**
organisation. In that organisation you will have a **personal** **unit** that has the same name as your username. You can
select that **Default** Organisation and your personal unit. These personal units are designed primarily for your own
private use, though you can still make your projects **public** or add other people to your project so that you can collaborate.

One you have a **unit** selected then you can select a **project** from that unit, or create a new **project**.

Finally select the project you want to work in by checking the radio button next to the project name.
When you close the settings dialog then you will be working in that **project**, and the name of the **organisation**,
**unit** and **project** will be displayed in the top right corner.

Owners of an **organisation** can create a new **unit** within it if you want a different work space (e.g. research
group, department etc.). The **Default** **organisation** cannot have **units** added to it other than a user's
**personal** unit.

# Concepts

This page describes some key concepts that are useful to know when using the Squonk Data Manager

## Users

A *user* is a logged in user of the Data Manager. They are defined in our Keycloak Single Sign On (SSO) system.
You will need an account setting up there in order to become a user. Once done you are potentially able to use
any of the Squonk applications.

## Projects Organisations and Units

The Data Manager has the concept of an _Organisation_ (e.g. your company or university) and within that
Organisation you have _Units_ (e.g. a research group or department).
A _Project_ is where you can do some work and collaborate with others, and _Projects_ belong to a _Unit_.
A _Project_  allows to isolate your work and provide access to it to specific users.
Projects can be shared with users outside your organisation if you wish.
The _Unit_ is responsible for the usage of all its projects and will need to pay the costs for that usage.

There is a _Default_ Organisation which all users can belong to, and within that _Default_ _Organisation_ you will be
given your own _Personal_ unit where you can create _Projects_. Alternatively, we can set up and organisation for you
and your coworkers, or can set up a complete Squonk2 environment for you.

## Project tiers

A project is allocated to a particular _Tier_.

* Evaluation - limited quota and all data is public
* Bronze - limited quota and data can be made private
* Silver - like bronze but with more quota
* Gold - like silver but with more quota

_Evaluation_ _Projects_ are always public and visible to all users, but are free to use.
Projects in other tiers can be made private and restricted to specific users. See below for more info.

## Datasets

Datasets are files that you can work with. You don't need to use datasets to do some work in Data Manager, but
using them has the following benefits:

* Datasets can be shared with other users.
* Datasets can be versioned.
* Metadata is indexed e.g. descriptions and data types of the fields in a SD-file.
* Datasets with molecules (e.g. SD-files) are indexed with the RDKit cartridge, which in future will allow structure
  searches to be performed to identify the use of molecules, or similar molecules in other Datasets.
* Other useful operations on datasets will follow.

Datasets visible to you are displayed on the _Datasets_ tab.

## The project Workspace

As mentioned, a _Project_ is where you do your work, which can be kept private or shared with other users.
Typically you work with normal files in your project. The project can be thought of as a bit of disk space accessible
only to users of your _Project_. That disk space is accessible when your run applications or jobs (see below).
You have complete control over what you do in your project.

Files can be added to a project so that you can work on them.
_Datasets_ can also be _attached_ to a project, and project files can be added as new _Datasets_.
Files will also typically be created in your project by running *applications* and *jobs*.

## Access Control

Only you and people you have added to your project can access the files in your project.

File access is controlled by standard POSIX permissions, with files typically being read and writable by the user and
the group.

Each user has a unique user id and each project has an unique group id, with all users added to the project being
members of that group. This means that, with the file permissions described above, users added to your project have
read-write access to your files. Other users will be able to see the files if the project is a public project but not
if it is private.

## Applications

An application is something that can be launched and run for a period of time (including several days).
The application typically has access to your project's bit of disk space so can work with its files.

Currently the only application we have is Jupyter Notebooks. You can start a notebook to work with your files, and
your notebook .ipynb file is also stored in your project providing a record of your work.

The application runs as a Kubernetes pod in the Kubernetes cluster in which Data Manager is running.

## Jobs

Jobs are a bit like very specialised applications. The are designed to process data in a very specific way, but allowing
the user to specify the parameters of how the processing is performed. We have a wide range of jobs.

To help illustrate this we'll use the
[max-min-picker](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/virtual-screening/blob/main/data-manager/docs/rdkit/max-min-picker.md)
job as an example. This allows a diverse subset of molecules to be selected from a set of input molecules.
When you run the job you are prompted for various parameters such as the inputs and the number of molecules to pick.

That particular job is implemented as a Python module, using RDKit, but there are lots of ways of creating jobs.
A guide to creating jobs can be found [here](https://informaticsmatters.gitlab.io/squonk2-data-manager/1-0/creating-new-jobs.html).
Creating jobs is a role for a developer, but using them once they have been deployed is very easy.

Like applications, jobs run as Kubernetes pods. Some jobs are very simple and complete in seconds, whilst others can run
complex parallelised workflows and take hours to complete.

We encourage 3rd parties to contribute jobs, and would like to point out that there is a mechanism to monitise your
jobs should you need to so you get paid when other users run you jobs. See the next section for more details.

## Resource Usage

How is this all paid for?

Well, if you are an organisation deploying a Squonk2 environment to your own Kubernetes cluster (or if Informatics
Matters is doing this for you) then you are already paying for the CPU and memory resources being used.
If you are using our public evaluation site then we make _Evaluation_ tier projects available for free, but all data
in them is public so visible to any user, and these have limited resource quotas.
If you want to keep your data private or need more resources then you can subscribe your project to the
Bronze, Silver or Gold tiers, which differ mostly in the usage quotas, with Gold having the highest quota.

Billing is not yet implemented, but once it is you will pay monthly fees for Bronze, Silver and Gold Tier projects.
The responsibility for payment is at the _Unit_ or _Organisation_ level. If you are using your own _Personal_ unit in the
_Default_ _Organisation_ you are responsible for payment of your Bronze, Silver and Gold Tier projects.

Usage is managed using a concept of _Squonk Coins_ (or coins for short). A coin has a monetary value, and your projects
get a monthly quota of coins (Gold tier projects get the biggest quota).
Coins are "consumed" by one of these activities:
* Storage used by your project (e.g. the size of all the files in GBs)
* Execution of applications or jobs
* Dataset storage

Storage usage is fairly straight forward. At regular periods each day the storage is calculated and recorded. The maximum
daily usage is then used to deduct the appropriate number of coins from your project's account. We also do a linear
projection of what your current usage will cost by the end of your billing month, but of course this is only an estimate.

Application and job usage is handled differently. Each time an application or job is run it can consume coins that reflect:
* The CPU, GPU and memory resource needed for execution
* Any IP or licensing costs

Don't worry, most jobs are free or have such a trivial cost that has no impact.
But some jobs (e.g. virtual screening using docking) consume lots of CPU so have a real cost of execution.
Also, some jobs might have significant IP value or use commercial software that has to be paid for so those can have
costs of execution.

As of the time of writing, the mechanism for defining job usage is quite basic and no payment systems are in place so
there is no need to be concerned about clocking up big bills. And even once in place you can be reassured that the costs
will be very reasonable! And we believe this "marketplace" concept where one user can provide access to a job or application
that has high value to other users and the supplier of that IP can get rewarded for it if they wish is a unique concept
of Squonk that makes total sense.

Also needing some description is _Dataset_ usage. You may recall that you can only use _Datasets_ if you want to (but
probably you should!). Those datasets consume their own storage outside of any project, so we also have consumption of
coins for _Datasets_ used by any _Unit_. Typically this is not much of an issue, but if you are wanting to use _Datasets_
of large size (e.g. many GBs) then this might impact your _Unit's_ costs.

Finally, what happens when you hit your quota limit? Typically you can keep working, but the coins consumed above your
quota are added to your monthly bill at a higher rate than you get when you buy the Bronze, Silver or Gold tier
project. If you don't want the unexpected "end of month" bill then your can specify to not exceed your quota (or only
exceed it by a certain number of coins).
Once you hit your hard quota limit then operations in the _Data Manager_ that consume coins (adding new files, running
jobs etc.) are disabled. You can still see your data, and remove unnecessary files. And you can upgrade to a tier with
a bigger quota.

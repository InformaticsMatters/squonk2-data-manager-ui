Welcome to the **Squonk Data Manager**, a tool designed for running **scientific workflows**.

The **Squonk Data Manager** is at the core of the Squonk 2.0 suite of applications.
It provides a managed environment for your data and allows execution of applications and jobs that use that data to
derive new data.
Currently it is focussed around **virtual screening** workflows, but the scope will expand over time.

Data is at the heart of the Squonk Data Manager. Your datasets stay in the same place, and applications fire up around
the data. This is the _"bring the compute to the data"_ paradigm.

This managed data environment is highly collaborative in nature, allowing sharing of data and skills across a workgroup,
but in a secure manner.

All of this takes place in a Kubernetes cluster, providing high resilience and potential scalability.

These are some of the things you can do:
* Select molecules for virtual screening based of molecular properties or chemical similarity ([see here](https://discourse.squonk.it/t/use-case-prepare-candidate-molecules/101))
* Generate 3D conformers
* Perform target based virtual screening (e.g. docking - [see here](https://discourse.squonk.it/t/use-case-docking-with-rdock/100))
* Perform ligand based virtual screening (e.g. 3D shape comparison)
* Run Jupyter Notebooks

## How to access

The **Squonk Data Manager** is in early stages of development. Access depends on which deployment you are using, but for
the [public evaluation site](https://squonk.it/data-manager-ui) is currently by invitation only.
Please email us at info@informaticsmatters.com if you would like to evaluate or want further information.

## Quick start

1. Log in
2. Create a **Project** or select an existing one.
3. Upload files to your project or attach existing datasets.
4. Use the **Executions** tab to launch a Jupyter notebook or execute jobs that work on those datasets.
5. View those executions nd their results in the **Results** tab.

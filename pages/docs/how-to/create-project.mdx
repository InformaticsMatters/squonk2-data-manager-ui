## Creating projects - a How To guide

You can create a new project in the **Settings tab**. See the
<InternalLink href="context">Setting your work context How To guide</InternalLink> for general info about your project context.
This guide deals with the specifics of creating a **new project**.

A **project** is created within your currently selected **unit**. You can only do this in your own **personal **unit**
within the **Default** **organisation** or within a **unit** of another **organisation** if you are an owner of that
**unit**. The **organisation** owner needs to make you a member of the **unit**. You *do not* need to be a member of
a **unit** in order to use a **project** in that **unit**. The owner of the **project** can dd you as an **editor**
or the project to give you write access to the **project** and you will have read access to any public projects in the
unit.

The *Create Project* button will be present in the *Context* section of the *Settings panel* if you are able to create a
project in the current **context**. If you click on this you get a dialog that lets you specify the project details.

You need to give your new project a sensible name, choose which tier of project you want and whether you want the project
to be public or private (Evaluation tier projects cannot be private).

The different tiers are described in the <InternalLink href="../concepts">Concepts guide</InternalLink>.

Once you have made your choices click on the CREATE button to create your project.
Remember that teh owner of the **unit** is responsible for the costs of your project. In the case of a **personal unit**
in the **Default organisation** that means you!
